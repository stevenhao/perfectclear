- improve stream experience: music, last 10 outcomes (e.g. 5 10 10 10 20 10 15 5 10 10 10); 5 = gold, 10 = green, everything else = red
  - stream interaction / chatbot
  - display most recent clear in tetris diagram format (1-3 diagrams; new diagram whenever an out-of-order line clear occurs)
  - add documentation for API endpoints used by the web client

- better testing/analysis tools for algorithm success rate
  - benchmark it by generating a random sequence of 10 (with arbitrary 7-bag piece offset)
 
- testing tools:
  - given a set of 11-piece sequences, run them all through the engine and report what % fail.
  - visualizations to aid analysis of a failing 11-piece sequence; better presentation of intermediate states like "best continuation after each move" and "book score", so that we can understand what the engine is thinking

  
- improve algorithm
  - these should all be guided by analysis/backtesting tools; try to find a common thread between sequences that fail5
  - HYPOTHESIS: sequences where there are repeats in the last 5 of the 11 pieces are more likely to fail
    - if this explains 90% of the misses, then two approaches help:
      - include repeat-piece positions in book
      - use 7-bag awareness to run monte-carlo simulations with 11 piece queues on first move, 10 piece queues on second move 9 piece queues on third move, and picking the best move based on multiple (e.g. 10) trials
     solution is to expand queue mask to 2^14 instead 2^7
  - curate shortlist of (top 3) first moves using existing beam search strategy
  - iterate over shortlist, and evaluate each using monte-carlo predictive strats & counting frequency of win
  - find & fix dumb correctness bugs
